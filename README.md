Impact of Car Features on Price and Profitability

Description:
The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a
growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological
innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing
consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors
that drive consumer demand for cars.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles
and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At
the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with
varying fuel types and grades available to consumers.
For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car
manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize
profitability while meeting consumer demand?
This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's
features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories
are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using
data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the
manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with
profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product
development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in
the market and increase its profitability over time.


Tech stack used:
1. Microsoft Excel - Used for data preprocessing
2. Python - EDA
Data Description:
The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled
"Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a
private college located in New York City.
Here is a brief overview of the dataset:
● Number of observations: 11,159
● Number of variables: 16
● File type: CSV (Comma Separated Values)
The variables in the dataset are:
● Make: the make or brand of the car
● Model: the specific model of the car
● Year: the year the car was released
● Engine Fuel Type: the type of fuel used by the car (gasoline, diesel, etc.)
● Engine HP: the horsepower of the car's engine
● Engine Cylinders: the number of cylinders in the car's engine
● Transmission Type: the type of transmission (automatic or manual)
● Driven_Wheels: the type of wheels driven by the car (front, rear, all)
● Number of Doors: the number of doors the car has
● Market Category: the market category the car belongs to (Luxury, Performance, etc.)
● Vehicle Size: the size of the car
● Vehicle Style: the style of the car (Sedan, Coupe, etc.)
● Highway MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets on the highway
● City MPG: the estimated miles per gallon the car gets in the city
● Popularity: a ranking of the popularity of the car (based on the number of times it has
been viewed on Edmunds.com)
● MSRP: the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the car
This dataset could be useful for a variety of data analysis tasks, such as:
● Exploring trends in car features and pricing over time
● Comparing the fuel efficiency of different types of cars
● Investigating the relationship between a car's features and its popularity
● Predicting the price of a car based on its features and market category


However, it's important to note that the dataset was last updated in 2017, so it may not reflect
current trends or prices in the automotive industry.
